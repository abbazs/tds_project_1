We also tested it with our friends\u2019 **GA questions**, and it\u2019s working as expected.\n\nThis project was a **team effort** by me and two friends [ [@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654) and [@23f2004637](/u/23f2004637) ], and we are thrilled with the results post-deployment.\n\nI would love the opportunity to **demonstrate our project** to **TA and Anand Sir** in a **Google Meet session** on **March 31st** (since I have OPPE on the 29th and 30th).\n\nIf you can spare some time for a quick look at our project, it would be awesome! Looking forward to your response.",

It would be great if you demonstrate it in today\u2019s live session at 8pm. Otherwise next week is all about project 2 discussion.",

However, I won\u2019t be able to present the project in a public session as my **Azure API URL would be exposed**, and since it incurs **costs per usage**, I need to keep it secure.\n\nI\u2019d prefer a **private meet** to demonstrate the project. Please let me know if that can be arranged. Looking forward to discussing it!",
