      "content": "Dear all,\n\nI\u2019m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the \\*Tools in Data Science \\* course: [**LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator**](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom). This is the basic prototype.\n\nThis tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators.\n\nA heartfelt thanks to **[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)**, our course instructor, and TAs **[@Carlton](/u/carlton)** and **[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)**, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible.\n\nI\u2019d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:\n\n* Expand functionality and evaluation models.\n* Fix bugs and optimize workflows.\n* Improve documentation for broader accessibility.\n\nThe [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom) is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!\n\nUpdate: here is a video explaining the process - <https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared>  \nBest regards,  \nAvinash Shrivastava",
