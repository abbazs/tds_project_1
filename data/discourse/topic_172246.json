I\u2019ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?  \nAs the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?\n\nThank you and Regards  \nAkshit",

We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated \u201cbest 4 out of 7\u201d policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment.
