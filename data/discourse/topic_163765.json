Thanks for the reminder, please bear with the inconvenience while its being fixed.\n\n**The last submission is always saved. So please make sure that your last submission contains all the answers for all the questions.**\n\nKind regards",

      "content": "Hello,  \nI am also facing the same issue. In my last submission the score was 7.25. Right now it is showing 0. The problem is i had few questions remaining to solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?",
