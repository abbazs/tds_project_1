I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.\n\n### 1. Graded Assignments (GA)\n\n* **GA6 Doubts Unresolved:** While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. [(Thread link)](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/graded-assignment-6/169283)\n* **GA Platform Changes:** Initially, we were solving questions on [exam.sanand.workers.dev](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev) . However, in GA6, we moved to *Seek* and in GA7, to *Google Forms*. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\n### 2. Project Updates\n\n* **Project 1:** The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n* **Project 2:** There are multiple doubts posted in the *Project 2* discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? [(thread link)](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/29)\n\n### 3. ROE Score Update\n\n* While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\n\nI appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards,  \nLakshay",

However, in GA6, we moved to *Seek* and in GA7, to *Google Forms*. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\n\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\n\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/lakshaygarg654/48/129814_2.png) lakshaygarg654:\n\n> **Project 1:** The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\n\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/lakshaygarg654/48/129814_2.png) lakshaygarg654:\n\n> ### 3. ROE Score Update\n>\n> * While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\n\nYou got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.\n\nKind regards",

      "content": "Thank you for your response [@carlton](/u/carlton) and for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.\n\nThe reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.\n\nWe will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.\n\nMeanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated.  \nLooking forward to your response.\n\nRegards,  \nLakshay",
